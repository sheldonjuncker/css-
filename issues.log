This document contains a list of the known issues with TCSS>

1. Semicolons
Because of the structure of the parser, semicolons are requried to end lines. But in the CSS standard, final declarations do not need semicolons.

2. Media Queries
Probably the most complicated aspect of CSS is media queries. TCSS currently has no capability for them at all and I will need to research all of the possible queries and build them into if-statements.
